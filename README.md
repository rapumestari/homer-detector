This project is about building an image classifier from scratch using the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leveraging a powerful detection model via transfer learning, and culminating in a creative image generation task.
Accuracy is around 88%. 
The dataset has 500 images of homer and 500 of 5 other chosen charachters according to school assigment.
The accuracy would improve with bigger dataset alone. Adding more advanced optimization techniques would further improve the accuracy.
